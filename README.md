# TimeStatistics (Python, SQLLite)
A program that monitors what windows you are interacting with and logs the amount of time spent. Used to be aware of how you are spending your time and if there are things to do with it.
To use, have starter.exe run for some time and it will track the windows you have open. When you're ready to see the details, you can run GUIControl.exe to export it to a CSV file, and from there you can do any excel operations on the data
